# Hali_Shift_withNF
Repository for Atlantic Halibut shift analysis about the Hague line, before and during a warming period, using Core Areas
<br> 

## Data Preparation  
Data from multiple RV surveys, and environmental covariates are combined into a single dataframe (Halibut_Catch_Covariates_Scaled_*date*.csv: Al11 includes the flemmish cap (NAFO 3M), Al14 does not...removed due do very sparse data challenging model fitting process, this can be re-visited late but because NF is not focus here, ok) 
- **1.1DataPrep_CombineSurveyData.R**: combine survey data   
  - **all_unique_towsAl4.rds**: a combined dataframe for each unique tow (longitude, latitude, trawl_id, season, year, survey, date, swept) 
  - **all_raw_halibut_catchAl4.rds**: a combined dataframe for Atlantic Halibut survey data at each unique tow 
  - **all_raw_halibut_catch_formattedAl4.rds**: reformatted the survey catch data, suited to VAST input requirements 
<br> 

- **1.2DataPrep_addBNAMcovariates.R**: BNAM surface and bottom temperature folders each contain annual folders with monthly temperature .mat files.  They are to be stacked into a single raster stack and then the respective values assigned to the survey catch data. 
  - *process_mat_to_raster_stack()*- This function processes individual .mat files and converts the data into a raster stack 
  - *process_all_mat_files()*- This function applies process_mat_to_raster_stack() to all .mat files in a  folder, and combines them into a single large raster stack. 
  - **all_raw_halibut_catch_with_covariates_Al14.csv**: Surface Temperature, Bottom Temperature, and Depth are extracted from the raster stacks and assigned to all_raw_halibut_catch_formattedAl4.rds based on the date and location. 
  - Plot How many tows occur at each depth and how much are they catching there per survey  
  -**Halibut_Catch_Covariates_Scaled_AL14.csv**: at April 14, 2025.  Covariates, removed outliers, scaled and to have a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1. 


- **1.2DataPrep_add_BNAM_GEBCO.R**: same as above but with GEBCO depth data
  -**Halibut_Catch_Covariates_Scaled_June19.csv**:   Covariates, removed outliers, scaled and to have a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1, Filtered depth to -30 to -1000m. 
<br> 

## Supplemental 
**Sup1install_INLA.R: getting started** 
- Downloading different versions of INLA and TMB, the wrong combinations will cause errors. 
- I landed on: R 4.4.1, INLA 24.12.11, and TMB 1.9.15  
**Sup2DataPlotst.R: pre-requisite to any script that does any mapping** 
- Plot 1: Map of Core areas ...this needs to be loaded anytime you want to do any mapping because it houses all the supporting spatial data  
**Sup3TMB_Error_fix.R: pre-requisite to any script that calls on TMB functions** 
- When you try some commands that use TMB, you will get an error ('"TMBconfig" not available for .Call() for package') 
**Sup4DataPlot.R: Explore the raw data a bit more**  
- Makes Supplemental Figure 1: Footprint of NEFSC and DFO Maritimes, and NF  RV surveys
- Makes Supplemental Figure 2: Panel plot showing the data availability by Year
<br>

## Run Model and Diagnostics  
- **2.1FitFullMod.R**: This is the original SDM based on "A species distribution modeling workflow to project changes in marine  species occurrence in the northwest Atlantic" - Gulf of Maine Research Institute: Integrated Systems Ecology  Laboratory   
  - https://gulfofmaine.github.io/sdm_workflow/docs/index.html#preface 
  - **Formula**: ~ season + bs(Depth, degree = 2, intercept = FALSE) + bs(Bottom temp, degree = 2, intercept = FALSE) + st(Surface temp, degree = 2, intercept = FALSE) 
  - **Data**: NEFSC, DFO Maritimes, and DFO Newfoundland RV surveys combined using catchability formula (survey is treated as a factor )
    - Years 1990- 2023, Spring, Summer, Fall 
    - Strata: whole area, USA, Canada, and the 12 core areas, this allows the model to calculate some shift analysis statistics at each of these levels 
  - **Output**: *Null_mod_fit.rds, EnvOnly_mod_fit.rds, Sp_mod_fit.rds, SpST_mod_fit.rds, vast_samp_dat.csv*  
<br> 

- **2.1DiagnosticsValidataion.R**: Model diagnostics, evaluation and validation statistics  
  1. Default plots: For diagnostic purposes, model plotting function writs plots folder,but we need to do pull these functions apart later so that we can get at the indexed data 
  2. Co-variate effects and plots: plot the co-variate effects and then look at the shape/strength of the response curves for each linear predictor
  3. Deviance & AIC...how well does the model fit the data 
  4. Parameter Estimates: Pulled from the SD report and t test (Estimate / SE) to see which parameters are more likely to be statistically significant 
  5. AUC: measure model strength at distinguish between the positive and negative classes 
  6. Taylor diagram
  7. Plot random effects (Omega, Epsilon, R, P)...spatial
  8. DHARMa plots
  9. RMSE and MAE
<br>

### Distance from Hague 
**6.1Distance_From_Hague.R** Calculate Distance from a fixed point on the hague line to the Centre of gravity (Mean, Median, Q5 and Q95) for time series and grouping using seasonal_centroid_data  
  1. Hague line and centriod data are turned to spatial points. A subset of the Hague line is also made to prevent Browns, Sable, CB, and Gully from estimating across land 
  2. *find_nearest_point():* function identifies the nearest hague_point to each centroid in the timeseries and creates a df that has a "closest" point for each year/season/grouping 
  3. *calculate_distances():* function created df by calculating the distance between each "closest" point and the corresponding centriod 
  4. **Output** for Mean, Median, Q5 and Q95 (by year/season/grouping) are joined into one dataframe: *dist_hague_all_seasonal.csv, dist_hague_Reg_seasonal.csv, dist_hague_CA_seasonal.csv*    
  
Note from Jim: You could instead do this similar to Deepening, but instead using Water Distance to Border instead of bathymetry as covariate for abundance-weighted averaging.
