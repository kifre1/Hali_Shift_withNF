          - **Direction**: 13° north of east (or 77° east of north)
        - **Statistical significance**: Eastward movement significant (p = 0.01225)
        
        ## Combined Total Shift (1990-2023)
        - **Total period**: 34 years
        - **Combined northward shift**: 42.94 + 61.76 = **104.70 km north**

            - **Total distance**: √(104.70² + 213.65²) = **238.27 km**
              - **Overall direction**: 26° north of east (or 64° east of north)
            
            ## Final Position Estimate
            Starting from leading edge position (56°W, 45°N), the leading edge COG has moved:
              - **104.70 km north** and **213.65 km east**
              - **Total distance**: **238.27 km** in direction 26° north of east
            - **Final approximate position**: ~45.94°N, ~53.08°W
            
            ## Total Distance Summary
            **Total Distance: 238.27 km**
              
              This represents the straight-line distance from the original position to the final position after 34 years of movement.
            
            ## Key Observations
            - **Period 1 (1990-2005)**: Northwest movement (66.36 km total) - contracting westward
            - **Period 2 (2006-2023)**: Dramatic shift to northeast movement (271.35 km total) - expanding eastward
            - **Massive directional change**: From 40° north of west to 13° north of east
            - The eastward acceleration in the second period was statistically significant and extreme (14.68 km/year)
            - Leading edge showed much more dramatic movement than trailing edge (238.27 km vs 79.22 km)
            - The leading edge "flipped" from contracting westward to rapidly expanding eastward

TRAILING
From the analysis for the 2006-2023 period:
  Total shift: 69.78 km
Direction: 10° north of east (or 80° east of north)
This period was characterized by:
  
  12.07 km northward movement
68.73 km eastward movement
Predominantly eastward movement with minimal northward component
The eastward shift was statistically significant (p = 0.047244)
Much more dramatic movement compared to the 1990-2005 period (69.78 km vs 18.27 km)

The movement during this period was almost due east, with just a slight northward component.

        ## Combined Total Shift (1990-2023)
        - **Total period**: 34 years
        - **Combined northward shift**: 17.65 + 12.07 = **29.72 km north**
          - **Combined eastward shift**: 4.71 + 68.73 = **73.44 km east**
            - **Total distance**: √(29.72² + 73.44²) = **79.22 km**

            ## Final Position Estimate
            Starting from COG position (68.5°W, 41°N), the trailing edge COG has moved:
              - **29.72 km north** and **73.44 km east**
              - **Total distance**: **79.22 km** in direction 22° north of east
            - **Final approximate position**: ~41.27°N, ~67.84°W
            
            ## Total Distance Calculation
            **Total Distance: 79.22 km**
              
              This represents the straight-line distance from the original position to the final position after 34 years of movement.
            
            ## Key Observations
            - **Period 1 (1990-2005)**: Primarily northward movement (18.27 km total)
            - **Period 2 (2006-2023)**: Dramatic shift to predominantly eastward movement (69.78 km total)
            - The movement pattern changed significantly between periods - from north-dominated to east-dominated
            - The eastward acceleration in the second period was statistically significant
            - No longitudinal (east-west) movement is reported in the data
